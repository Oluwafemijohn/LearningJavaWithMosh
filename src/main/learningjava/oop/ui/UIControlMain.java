    //Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

    // For abstract classes, we can't create an instance of it.
    // We can only create an instance of a class that inherits from it.
    //The class that inherits from it must implement all the abstract methods or it must be declared abstract itself.

     * Final methods cannot be overridden.
     * Final variables cannot be reassigned.
     * Final variables must be initialized.
     * Final variables are constants.

     * Math.PI
